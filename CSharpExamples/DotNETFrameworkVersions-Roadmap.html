    .NET Core and .NET 5 refer to several technologies including the runtime, ASP.NET Core, and Entity Framework Core.

    Looking for the support policy for another part of the .NET platform? See the .NET Support Policy page.

    Every Microsoft product has a lifecycle. The lifecycle begins when a product is released and ends when it's no longer supported. Knowing key dates in this lifecycle helps you make informed decisions about when to upgrade or make other changes to your software. This product is governed by Microsoft's Modern Lifecycle Policy.

    The .NET Core and .NET 5 support lifecycle offers support for each release. The length of time and degree of support vary based on a few qualifications.

    What releases qualify for servicing and how do updates effect servicing qualifications?
    Customers can choose Long Term Support (LTS) releases or Current releases. LTS releases will receive only critical and compatible fixes throughout their lifecycle. Current releases will receive these same fixes and will also be updated with compatible innovations and features.

    Within a release's support lifecycle, systems must remain current on released patch updates.

    .NET Core release lifecycle
    Supported versions
    The following table tracks release dates and end of support dates for .NET Core versions.

    Version	Original Release Date	Latest Patch Version	Patch Release Date	Support Level	End of Support
    .NET Core 3.1	December 3, 2019	3.1.9	October 13, 2020	LTS	December 3, 2022
    .NET Core 2.1	May 30, 2018	2.1.23	October 13, 2020	LTS	August 21, 2021
    Out of support versions
    The following table lists .NET Core versions no longer supported.

    Version	Original Release Date	Latest Patch Version	Patch Release Date	End of Support
    .NET Core 3.0	September 23, 2019	3.0.3	February 18, 2020	March 3, 2020
    .NET Core 2.2	December 4, 2018	2.2.8	November 19, 2019	December 23, 2019
    .NET Core 2.0	August 14, 2017	2.0.9	July 10, 2018	October 1, 2018
    .NET Core 1.1	November 16, 2016	1.1.13	May 14, 2019	June 27 2019
    .NET Core 1.0	June 27, 2016	1.0.16	May 14, 2019	June 27 2019
    Preview releases
    .NET preview releases are supported through Microsoft Developer Support only if they're specifically designated 'Go-Live'. In such cases, the license allows you to deploy applications built on the specified .NET, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core preview to production environments and provides access to Microsoft Support. For an explanation of available support options, visit Support for Business and Developers.

    The support lifecycle for applicable pre-releases is as follows.

    Version	Release Date	End of Support
    .NET 5 RC 2	October 13, 2020	November 10, 2020
    .NET 5 RC 1	September 14, 2020	October 13, 2020
    .NET release cadence
    We'll publish new major releases of .NET on a regular cadence, enabling developers, the community, and businesses to plan their roadmaps. Starting with .NET 5, these releases will happen every November and every other release will be LTS.

    Long Term Support (LTS)
    LTS releases are supported for three years after the initial release.

    .NET Core 1.x was released under an earlier definition of LTS. For more details, see .NET Core 1.x "shorter" LTS definition.

    .NET Core 2.1 was only declared an LTS release when we released 2.1.3, on August 2018. That's why the end of support is a bit longer than three years from the original release date.

    Current
    Current releases are supported for three months after a subsequent Current or LTS release.

    How do the different support tracks work?
    Customers choosing LTS will need the latest patch update installed to qualify for support. If a system is running 3.1 and 3.1.x has been released, 3.1.x will need to be installed as a first step. Once a patch update has been installed, applications will begin using the update by default. LTS releases will be supported for 3 years after general availability, or for a 12-month Maintenance period after the next LTS release ships, whichever is longer.

    In addition to staying current with the latest patch update, customers using Current need to update as new minor versions are released to stay in support. The latest released minor version will become the minimum serviceable baseline after release. After a 3-month Maintenance period, the previous minor version will no longer be supported. For example, after 3.1 was released, systems running version 3.0 had 3 months to update to 3.1 to remain eligible for support.

    End of support
    End of support refers to the date when Microsoft no longer provides fixes, updates, or online technical assistance. End of support may also be referred to as 'end of life' or abbreviated 'EOL'. This is the time to make sure you have the latest available update installed.

    Updates are cumulative, with each update built upon all of the updates that preceded it. A device needs to install the latest update to remain supported. Updates may include new features, fixes (security and/or non-security), or a combination of both. Not all features in an update will work on all devices. Update availability may vary, for example by country, region, network connectivity, or hardware capabilities (including, for example, free disk space).

    ASP.NET Core 2.1 on .NET Framework
    Support for ASP.NET Core 2.1 on .NET Framework matches the ASP.NET Support policy for other package-based ASP.NET frameworks. The complete list of packages covered by this policy can be seen in ASP.NET Core 2.1 Supported Packages.

    What operating system versions are supported to run .NET Core and .NET 5 applications?
    .NET Core and .NET 5 are supported across several operating systems and versions. The .NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy provides current details on operating systems support policies and versions.
