.NET Roadmap & Future Plan:
===========================
In 2002, Microsoft released .NET Framework, a development platform for creating Windows apps. Today .NET Framework is at version 4.8,  5,... and is still supported by Microsoft.

In 2014, Microsoft began writing a cross-platform, open-source successor to .NET Framework. This new implementation of .NET was named .NET Core until it reached version 3.1.
The next version after .NET Core 3.1 is .NET 5.0
Version number 4 was skipped to avoid confusion between this implementation of .NET and .NET Framework 4.8.
The name "Core" was dropped to make clear that this is now the main implementation of .NET.

This article is about .NET 5, but much of the documentation for .NET 5 still has references to ".NET Core" or ".NET Framework".
In addition, "Core" remains in the names ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core.

The documentation also refers to .NET Standard. .NET Standard is an API specification that lets you develop class libraries for multiple implementations of .NET.

For more information, see .NET architectural components.

.NET Core is a cross-platform version of .NET for building websites, services, and console apps.

.NET Core 3.1 is an LTS release with support from Microsoft for the next three years. It's highly recommended that you move your apps to .NET Core 3.1.
The current lifecycle of other major releases is as follows:
