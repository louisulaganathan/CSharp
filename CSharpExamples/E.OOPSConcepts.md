**Virtual, override, and abstract methods**


A virtual method can be overridden in a derived class. When an instance method declaration includes an override modifier, 
the method overrides an inherited virtual method with the same signature.


An abstract method is a virtual method with no implementation. An abstract method is declared with the abstract modifier and is permitted only in an abstract class. 
An abstract method must be overridden in every non-abstract derived class.
