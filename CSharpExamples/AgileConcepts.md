User Story Splitting - Vertical Slice vs Horizontal Slice
=========================================================

Before a user story is ready to be scheduled for implementation in an upcoming iteration, however, many user stories start out larger than that. To splitting one user story into smaller ones that should be:

    The user stories should be small enough that can be completed within one iteration.
    The user stories should preserve the property that each of these user stories separately has measurable business value.

Learning to split large user stories into smaller user stories is one of the best things a team can do to improve their scrum workflow.  Not only are smaller stories easier to understand and therefore easier to estimate, but their smaller size makes them inherently less risky for a team to take on. However, when people attempt to split a user story, they may not know it is more desirable to split a user story into a slice vertically rather than horizontally.

The granularity of User Stories in Product Backlog
==================================================
In Agile Development, User Stories are in the form of user features, epics, user stories, and timeboxed tasks in the product backlog managed by the product owner together with the agile team. A user feature may be proposed by the users or other stakeholders and put into the product backlog by the product owner. These features can’t be implemented directly and subject to prioritize and refined as it comes up in the order from the bottom and gradually to the top of the product backlog called “product backlog refinement”.

Product Backlog refinement is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog. Ongoing Product Backlog Refinement is needed within each Sprint to refine items to be ready for future Sprints.

Why Vertical Slice?
===================

The traditional approach is horizontal splitting and involves breaking down the features into the work that has to be done at architectural layers: one story for the UI, another for the database, front-end, and back-end are split up into groups of sub-tasks. This may work but fails actually at independent and valuable of INVEST guidelines for a good user story.

It’s recommended from an agile perspective that teams work on stories that consist of vertical pieces of the cake; in other words, slices. People don’t eat layers of a cake. We don’t eat all the top layer before we start eating the second layer – we cut the cake into slices (thin or thick, depending on your preference and diet) and then eat those. Again, looking at the cake as the whole product,

Let’s consider the “cake” analogy in an agile perspective, the idea is that a working demonstrable feature (software) is a multilayered cake. The cake would constitute all of the work and each layer would represent all of the work for that part of the product. A vertical slice of cake means a user story should contain work for as many of the different layers as possible.

Vertical Slice vs Horizontal Slice
===================================

A user story is broken down vertically, they are broken down in such a way that smaller items still result in working, demonstrable, software, or a specific working feature useful for the user. In other words, a vertical slice means a bit of every layer. Again as an example, a new feature request like “showing x information on the main screen” would contain these work bits:

    Work in the UX/UI that will display the information
    Work in the service layer to transform the information
    Work in the database layer to store/fetch the information.


Theme vs Epic vs User Story vs Task
===================================

Products are typically described by hundreds of requirements which are organized in the product backlog. Theme or epics cannot be completed in one sprint so they are broken into more user stories and subsequently a group of related tasks. Epics are then delivered in releases. But even small user stories from different epics can have something in common. Such a group of user stories is called a theme.
The Granularity of Product Backlog Items

Have you ever been confused by the use of terms like Theme (or feature) or epics in Agile Development? New-comers may not know what differences are and even lead to mistakes.

Scrum doesn’t have “stories”, “epics”, etc. Scrum has Product Backlog Items (PBIs), which are often prioritized, split and refined into epics, user stories, technical tasks, spikes and bugs in a just-in-time manner in the backlog grooming process.

Theme/user Feature
===================

A theme provides a convenient way to indicate that a set of related epics have something in common, such as being in the same functional area. By assigning a financial value to Themes, managers can ensure the highest value is being delivered and that the project/program is aligned with its objectives and the strategic direction of the organization.

Epic
=====

An Epic is useful as placeholders for large requirements. It probably won’t fit into a sprint and should be broken down into stories.  Epics are usually defined during the initial product roadmap and decomposed into stories in the product backlog as more is learned and is usually written in a User Story format. The decomposed stories in an epic have a common objective and a specific outcome or high-level user need or part of the journey or process someone takes in using the service.

User Stories
=============

User stories are the smallest units of user functionality in agile which can be delivered in one agile sprint.  They are typically estimated using story pointed and defined using INVEST criteria. User stories should deliver a vertical slice of functionality to the customer that is valuable and complete by the end of an iteration. A user story must deliver particular value to the user and must be describable in simple language that outlines the desired outcome.

Tasks
=====

Tasks are decomposed parts of a story that get into HOW the story will be completed. Tasks can be hour estimated if desired. Tasks are usually defined by the people doing the work (developers, QA, etc), whereas stories and epics are generally created by the customer or the product owner on behalf of the customer. Thus, the tasks no longer need to be understandable by business users and so can be highly technical. The process of breaking a story down into tasks also helps the development team better understand what needs to be done.

Organize your Product Backlog with Story Map
============================================

User Story Map is becoming a popular user story management technique through the efforts of Jeff Patton and others. The user story tool allows you to establish multiple levels and dimensions for a product backlog through the breakdown of user needs as user activities, user tasks, epics, and user stories. Typically, an agile development team makes use of a story map in collaborative meetings in identifying the desired results the end-users want to achieve.

3-level Story Map for Medium Size Project

The 3-level story map involves three compartments: Activities > Tasks > Stories (Default)

4-level Story Map for More Complex Project

The 4-level story map adds Epics into the 3-level map: Activities > Tasks > Epics > Stories

Estimate size, not estimate time period, use relative estimates instead of absolute estimates
================================================================================================

An estimate is nothing more than a well educated guess. We use all the knowledge and experience at hand to make a guess about the amount of time it is going to take. So instead of looking at every new work item separately, why not compare it to previously finished work items? It’s easier for humans to relate to similar items than to guess the actual size of things anyway.

For example, is it closer to this really small thing? Or is it more like this normal sized item? Or is it really huge like that one piece of work we finished last month? Doing relative estimates will not only reduce the amount of time spent on estimating work, it will also heavily increase the accuracy of the estimates.

Estimate Velocity – Record and Average the team speed of each Sprint
====================================================================

The team velocity is the number of story points that the Scrum team actually completes in a Sprint. The team velocity tells you how fast the team is doing. A newly estimated project or team (without referencing velocity records in the past), we can do1-2 Sprint to measure a speed as the initial speed. In the Sprint implementation process, we need to record the speed of each Sprint, for future plans.

What is Story Point in Agile? How to Estimate a User Story?
=============================================================

A story point is a metric used in agile project management and development to estimate the difficulty of implementing a given user story, which is an abstract measure of effort required to implement it. In simple terms, a story point is a number that tells the team about the difficulty level of the story. Difficulty could be related to complexities, risks, and efforts involved.

Story point estimation, a kind of relative estimation, is typically performed at the Product Backlog Grooming Sessions and the Product Backlog is evaluated by the team who responsible for the actual development and testing work.

In order to make the Sprint Planning more efficient in practice, PO and the Team will make a rough estimation called product backlog grooming before the Sprint Planning and check for:

    If the Sprint Plan is readily to be conducted efficiently?
    Is there enough information to complete these matters?
    Is the user story split reasonably?

Agile teams use story points and ‘estimating poker’ to value their work [1, 2]. A story point is a singular number that represents a combination of qualities: Volume – How much is there? Complexity – How hard is it? Knowledge – What’s known? Uncertainty – What’s unknown?

Fibonacci number for Story Point

When the development team conducts an estimation, it is recommended to abandon the traditional “human-day” assessment method, using the point of the story point, using the Fibonacci number (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21…) to estimate the story point (see Planning Poker article for detail).

How to do Agile Estimation?

In order to do that each team would have to find a baseline story. It does not necessarily to be the smallest one, but the one that everyone within the team can resonate with. Once determined, sizing of all the user stories should be initiated by comparing them against the baseline.

When estimating new stories all you have to do is pick a story and say: “will this take longer than reference story x?” or “will it be less than reference y?”  With enough reference stories there should be a suitable comparator to find a similar sized story and give it the same points or a bit more or a bit less based on a considered factor.

Effective User Stories - 3C's and INVEST Guide
=================================================

User Stories are the de-facto standard of capturing feature wishes in agile teams. User stories are often written from the perspective of an end-user or user of a system. In other words, a user story describes the type of user, what they want, and why. A user story helps to create a simplified description of a requirement. Depending on the project, user stories may be written by various stakeholders including clients, users, managers, or development team members.
User Story Template: Role-Action-Benefit

User stories only capture the essential elements of a requirement. in the format “As a <who> I want <what> so that <benefit>”:

Role – The user should be an actual human who interacts with the system.

    Be as specific as possible
    The development team is NOT a user

Action – The behavior of the system should be written as an action.

    Usually unique for each User Story
    The “system” is implied and does not get written in the story
    Active voice, not passive voice (“I can be notified”)

Benefits – The benefit should be a real-world result that is non-functional or external to the system.

    Many stories may share the same benefit statement.
    The benefit may be for other users or customers, not just for the user in the story.

User Story Examples

    As <a recruiter> I can <post new jobs> so that <applicants can find those jobs via search>
    As <a job seeker> I can <limit who sees my resume> so that <I have privacy>

 
The 3 C’s (Card, Conversation, Confirmation) of User Stories
==============================================
Card – a written description of the story used for planning and estimation.

Conversation – Discuss your ideas with others. Let them ask lots of questions. Work together to come up with ideal solutions. The goal is to build a shared understanding.

Confirmation – Work towards agreement on what to build. Record that agreement as a set of confirmation tests.

How to Write Good User Story with INVEST Guidelines

The acronym INVEST helps to remember a widely accepted set of criteria, or checklist, to assess the quality of a user story. If the story fails to meet one of these criteria, the team may want to reword it, or even consider a rewrite (which often translates into physically tearing up the old story card and writing a new one).

Independent – Each User Story should represent a distinct and independent set of business values such that, were it released on its own, it would deliver incremental value over the previous state.

Negotiable – While the end-goal may be clearly described, the methods by which that goal is achieved should be negotiable – between the Product Owner and the Development Team, the Product Owner and the Customer, or any other involved stakeholders – so as to prevent unrealistic constraints on the feature or functionality.

Valuable – The business value of any User Story should be readily recognizable by reading the story, and each story should represent some sort of value to a specific user type.

Estimable – We must have enough information that we can properly size a story so that we may properly plan and commit to our work. (But no more!)

Small – User Stories should be small enough that they are able to be completed within a sprint.

Testable – All members of the team need a clear and precise way to verify whether or not a User Story has been completed.

Note That:

INVEST are guidelines for quickly evaluating the quality of user stories originated in an article by Bill Wake, which also repurposed the acronym SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-boxed) for tasks resulting from the technical decomposition of user stories.


Story
======
Stories are short descriptions of a small piece of desired functionality, written in the user’s language. Agile Teams implement small, vertical slices of system functionality and are sized so they can be completed in a single Iteration. Stories are the primary artifact used to define system behavior in Agile. They are short, simple descriptions of functionality usually told from the user’s perspective and written in their language. Each one is intended to enable the implementation of a small, vertical slice of system behavior that supports incremental development. Stories provide just enough information for both business and technical people to understand the intent. Details are deferred until the story is ready to be implemented. Through acceptance criteria and acceptance tests, stories get more specific, helping to ensure system quality. User stories deliver functionality directly to the end user. Enabler stories bring visibility to the work items needed to support exploration, architecture, infrastructure, and compliance.


Enablers
==========
An Enabler supports the activities needed to extend the Architectural Runway to provide future business functionality. These include exploration, architecture, infrastructure, and compliance. Enablers are captured in the various backlogs and occur throughout the Framework. Details Enablers bring visibility to all the work necessary to support efficient development and delivery of future business requirements. Primarily, enablers are used for exploration, evolving the architecture, improving infrastructure and compliance activities. Since enablers reflect real work they cannot remain invisible. Instead, they’re treated like all other value-added development activities—subject to estimating, visibility and tracking, Work in Process (WIP) limits, feedback, and presentation of results. Type of Enablers Enablers can be used for any activities that support upcoming business requirements and generally fall into one of four categories: Exploration enablers – These support research, prototyping, and other activities needed to develop an understanding of customer needs, including the exploration of prospective Solutions and evaluating alternatives. Architectural enablers – These are created to build the Architectural Runway, which allows smoother and faster development. Infrastructure enablers – These are created to build, enhance, and automate the development, testing, and deployment environments. They facilitate faster development, higher-quality testing, and a faster Continuous Delivery Pipeline. Compliance enablers – These facilitate managing specific compliance activities, including Verification and Validation (V&V), documentation and signoffs, and regulatory submissions and approvals.
